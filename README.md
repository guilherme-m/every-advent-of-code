# Doing Every Year of Advent of Code

This is my attempt to do every year of the [Advent of Code](http://www.adventofcode.com) (AoC) challenge, since 2015.

I'm still learning to develop algorithms, so you will encounter some inefficient implementations. If you'd like to share some advice to improve them, I'll be happy to hear!

**Important**: Part of the fun of AoC is to come up with your own solution, so I recommend you try solving the problems before looking at the code.

Progress:
